# map-view-controls
Mouse control for THREE.OrthographicCamera that conserves planar pointer position while zooming with mouse wheel and panning with a mouse button. (Panning does not yet perfectly conserve cursor position on map.)

For 2D views

map-view-controls.js is an ES6 module.

build/MapViewControls.js is an UMD module.

A [world map example](https://eliashasle.github.io/map-view-controls/examples/map_example.html) is now available.
